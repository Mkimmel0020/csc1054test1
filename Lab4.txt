Questions:
1.	(5 points)  How are abstract classes used in this lab?

          a.	Abstract classes are used in this lab from our general Bird class. The general Bird abstract class
               was created that had some methods defined but there were some things related to a specific bird that 
               could not be defined which is why/when abstract classes are helpful.From the Bird class, 2 subclasses were 
               extended: the Hummingbird and the Penguin class.

2.	(5 points)  Why do we sometimes not want to use protected?
          a.	You don’t always want to use protected because it allows other potential coders to redefine a variable
               that you may have wanted to keep. Protected is good to use between classes but  not always the best to maintain
               encapsulation of data. 


3.	(5 points)  Summarize what inheritance does.
          a.	Inheritance creates classes that are built upon existing classes (or parent classes).  It allows the 
               subclasses to use/inherit the methods and fields of the parent class, but also allows you to add new methods 
               to the subclass. 

4.	(5 points)  What happens if we don’t override all abstract methods in an abstract class?
          a.	You get an error that the method is not defined in the extended class, but it is defined in the abstract class.
                You must override all abstract methods.
